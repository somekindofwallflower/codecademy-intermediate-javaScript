/* 

1- 
In this exercise, you will begin to create the Nurse class as a child of the HospitalEmployee class. Remember the Nurse class has the following properties and methods:

Nurse
Properties: _name, _remainingVacationDays (set to 20 inside constructor()), _certifications
Methods: .takeVacationDays(), .addCertification()
Under HospitalEmployee, create an empty class named Nurse that extends HospitalEmployee.

2- Inside the Nurse class, create a constructor() that accepts two arguments. Use the list of properties above to name these arguments.

3- In the Nurse constructor, call the parentâ€™s constructor method and pass the appropriate value(s).

4- Inside of the Nurse constructor, and under super, set _certifications.

5- Under the Nurse class, create a new instance of Nurse and save it to a constant variable named nurseOlynyk. Pass in the following values for each property:

name: 'Olynyk'
certifications: ['Trauma', 'Pediatrics']

class HospitalEmployee {
    constructor(name) {
      this._name = name;
      this._remainingVacationDays = 20;
    }
    
    get name() {
      return this._name;
    }
    
    get remainingVacationDays() {
      return this._remainingVacationDays;
    }
    
    takeVacationDays(daysOff) {
      this._remainingVacationDays -= daysOff;
    }
  }
  
  class Nurse extends HospitalEmployee {
    constructor(name, certifications) {
      super(name);
      this._certifications = certifications;
    }
  }
  
  
  const nurseOlynyk = new Nurse('Olynyk', ['Trauma', 'Pediatrics']);
